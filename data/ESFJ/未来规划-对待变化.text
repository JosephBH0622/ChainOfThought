Here's a breakdown of how an ESFJ high school student might think about future planning and dealing with change, along with specific events and thought processes:

```json
{
  "domain": "Future Planning - Dealing with Change",
  "events": [
    {
      "event": "College Application Deadline Approaching",
      "chain of thought": "I need to make sure I have all my applications in on time. I'll check with my guidance counselor and parents about the deadlines and requirements. I also want to make sure I'm applying to schools that are a good fit for me â€“ I want to be happy and successful. It would be helpful to visit the campuses and talk to current students. I want to find a place where I can make new friends, contribute to the community, and learn in a supportive environment."
    },
    {
      "event": "Unexpected Family Relocation",
      "chain of thought": "Oh no, that's a big change! I'll need to find a way to stay connected with my friends and make new ones at my new school. It's important to be kind and helpful to everyone, especially new people who might be feeling lost. I'll try to get involved in clubs and activities to meet new people and make the transition easier. I hope my new school is as welcoming and supportive as my old one."
    },
    {
      "event": "Unexpected Career Path Change",
      "chain of thought": "This is a big decision. It's important to talk to my parents, teachers, and maybe even a career counselor to get their advice. I want to be sure it's a career that I'll enjoy and be good at. I'll also need to consider the practicality of it, like how much money I can make and the job market. But most importantly, I want to find a job where I can help people and make a positive impact on the world."
    },
    {
      "event": "Friend Group Dynamic Shifts",
      "chain of thought": "It's normal for friendships to change over time. It's important to be understanding and supportive of my friends, even if we're going in different directions. I'll reach out to them and see how they're doing. I'll also try to make new friends and expand my circle. I want to make sure everyone feels included and supported."
    }
  ]
}

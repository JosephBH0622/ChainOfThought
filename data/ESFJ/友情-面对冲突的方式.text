I'll talk to my friend who's spreading the rumors and let them know it's not okay. I'll emphasize how important it is to be kind and supportive of our friends. I'll also talk to the other friend who's being gossiped about and let them know I'm there for them. I want to help everyone feel good and make sure our friendship stays strong."

I'll explain how their words made me feel and how important it is to be mindful of what we say. I'll try to do it calmly and gently, not wanting to make them feel bad, but I also need to be honest about how it affected me. I hope they understand."

I'll invite them to hang out sometime so we can catch up. I don't want to lose our friendship, and I hope they realize how much I value our connection."

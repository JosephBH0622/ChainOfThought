Then I'll research different options, taking into account everyone's preferences. I'll also check the budget and make sure everyone is on board with the plan. It's important to me that everyone feels included and happy. Maybe we could even plan some fun activities to do together as a family."

Maybe we can have a big family dinner or go out for a special meal.  I'll also think about what kind of gifts they'd like, maybe something sentimental or something practical they need.  I'll make sure to spend quality time with them and show them how much I love them."

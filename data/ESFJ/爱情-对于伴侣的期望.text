I'll listen attentively and ask thoughtful questions to get to know them better. I'll also share some things about myself, but I'll be mindful of not overwhelming them. I hope they enjoy spending time with me and feel comfortable being themselves. I want to know if we have shared values and interests, and if we can have fun together. I'll also observe their kindness and consideration towards others.  I'm looking for someone who is caring, supportive, and reliable, someone I can build a strong relationship with."

I'll offer practical help if I can, like making them dinner or running errands. If they need space, I'll respect that but let them know I'm there for them. I want them to feel loved and cared for. I hope I can help them feel better."

I'll be supportive and encouraging, even if it's something I'm not initially comfortable with. I want them to know I'm willing to step outside my comfort zone for them. It's important to me that we have shared experiences and create lasting memories together. I hope we have a good time!"

I'll listen to my partner's perspective and try to understand their point of view. I'll also share my thoughts and feelings openly, but in a kind way.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.  Communication and compromise are key to a healthy relationship."

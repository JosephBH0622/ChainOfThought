I'll talk to my parents, teachers, and maybe even a career counselor to get their advice. I'll also research different careers and see what interests me. I want to find a career path that I'll be passionate about and that will allow me to make a real contribution to society.

I'll trust my instincts and follow my heart. It's okay to be scared, but I know I can handle anything as long as I stay positive and focus on my goals."

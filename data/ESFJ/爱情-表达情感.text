I want to apologize and make things right.  Maybe we can talk about it calmly and figure out how to avoid this in the future. I'm worried about hurting their feelings and I want to make sure they know how much I care about them."

Maybe we can talk about what makes each of us feel secure in the relationship. I'm sure we can work it out. I value our relationship and I want to make it work."

Maybe I can take them out for coffee or just spend time with them to help them feel better.  I'm going to be their friend through this difficult time."

      "chain of thought": "Oh no, I studied so much! I'm really disappointed in myself. I need to talk to my teacher about it. Maybe I didn't understand something correctly, or I missed a key point.  I'll ask them what I can do better next time. I'll make sure to study differently for the next test, maybe try different methods. I want to make my parents proud and show them I can learn from my mistakes."

Maybe we can study together and help each other out.  I don't want to fall behind, so I need to make sure I grasp this concept. I want to be a good student and make my teachers and classmates proud of me."

I need to talk to them and see if there was something I could have done differently to help. Maybe I can encourage them to be more involved next time.  I'll try to stay positive and focus on what I can control.  I'm committed to doing my best in group projects, even if others don't."

It's important to prioritize and get the most important things done first.  I'm sure I can handle it if I stay organized.  I want to make sure I'm doing my best in all my classes."

I'll try to ignore the teasing and remember that everyone makes mistakes. I'm sure my classmates are trying to be funny, but it's important to be kind to everyone. I'm going to try to focus on my own learning and not worry about what others think."

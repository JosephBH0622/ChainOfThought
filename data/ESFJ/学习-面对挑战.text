I'm sure I can figure it out with some extra effort. If I'm still having trouble, I'll reach out to my friends or classmates for help. We can work together and support each other.

I'll make sure to communicate with my group members regularly to stay organized and on the same page. We can support each other and make sure everyone has a chance to contribute. I'm confident we can finish the project on time and do a great job.  It's important to show my teacher how hard-working and dedicated I am."

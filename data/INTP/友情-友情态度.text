Here's a breakdown of how an INTP American high school student might approach "友情-友情态度" (friendship-friendship attitude) scenarios, keeping their MBTI traits in mind:

Domain: Friendship Dynamics

Events:

1. Event: A friend is struggling with a personal issue (e.g., family conflict, academic pressure, social anxiety).

    Chain of thought:
     Initial Analysis: "Why is my friend upset? What's the logical root of their problem? What are the potential causes and consequences?"
     Seeking Understanding: "I need to understand their perspective and the emotional impact of the situation. What information do I need to gather? How can I ask questions without being intrusive?"
     Problem-solving Focus: "Is there a logical solution to their problem? What steps can be taken to alleviate the situation? Can I offer practical help or resources?"
     Emotional Consideration: "While I might not fully understand their emotions, I need to show empathy and support. How can I offer comfort without feeling forced or insincere?" 
     Respecting Boundaries: "I need to respect my friend's space and privacy. If they don't want to talk, I won't push them. I'll be there when they're ready."

2. Event:  A close friend starts hanging out with a group that the INTP doesn't fully trust.

    Chain of thought:
     Observation and Analysis: "Why has my friend started spending time with this group? What are the dynamics like? Is there any evidence of negative influence?"
     Value-Based Reasoning: "Does this group align with my friend's values? Are their actions and beliefs something I could accept for my friend? What potential risks are involved?"
     Open Communication: "I need to have an open conversation with my friend about my concerns. I'll try to express them logically and calmly, focusing on the potential impacts." 
     Respecting Choices: "Ultimately, my friend has the right to make their own decisions. However, I need to make sure they're aware of the potential consequences and support them if they need it."

3. Event:  The INTP realizes they have different interests and values than a friend.

    Chain of thought:
     Self-Reflection: "Why am I feeling this way? What are my core values and interests? What do I need from a friendship?"
     Understanding Differences: "It's okay to have differences. But are these differences fundamental and incompatible? What are the areas where we still connect?"
     Adaptability and Compromise: "Can I adapt my expectations or compromise on some points to maintain the friendship? How can I accept my friend for who they are?" 
     Growth Potential: "Can this difference be a source of growth? Can we learn from each other and broaden our perspectives?" 

4. Event:  A friend betrays the INTP's trust.

    Chain of thought:
     Logical Processing: "Why did this happen? What caused the betrayal? What were the consequences of this action?"
     Analyzing the Relationship: "Is this a pattern of behavior? Is this a fundamental breach of trust that can't be repaired? How does this affect the future of the friendship?"
     Emotional Processing: "I need to understand my feelings about the situation. Am I angry, hurt, or disappointed? How can I process these emotions healthily?"
     Decision-making: "What steps do I need to take? Do I confront the friend directly? Do I distance myself? What are the logical outcomes of each choice?"

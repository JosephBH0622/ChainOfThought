Here's a breakdown of how an INTP high school student might think about "个人成长-动力来源" (Personal Growth - Motivational Sources) events, along with a possible "domain" for this type of event:

**1. Event: Receiving Unexpectedly High Marks on a Test**

* **Chain of Thought:**
    * "Hmm, interesting. I didn't expect this. Did I really understand the material that well? Or was it just a lucky break?"
    * "Let me analyze the test again. What were the specific questions I got right? Was there a specific approach or method I used that I can apply to future tests?"
    * "Maybe I'm not as bad at this subject as I thought. This could be a sign of potential in this area."
    * "It's important to remember, though, that one good grade doesn't define me. I need to keep exploring and learning."
    * "This is a chance to expand my knowledge base and see how I can apply this information to other areas."

**2. Event: Witnessing a Powerful Debate on a Topic You're Passionate About**

* **Chain of Thought:**
    * "This is fascinating! Both sides have strong arguments. I need to understand the nuances of each perspective."
    * "What are the underlying logical frameworks that support each argument? Are there any flaws in their reasoning?"
    * "How does this debate challenge my own understanding of the issue? Am I missing any crucial information or perspectives?"
    * "This debate has sparked new questions in my mind. I need to delve deeper into this topic and research it further."
    * "It's important to keep an open mind and be willing to challenge my own preconceptions."

**3. Event:  Feeling Lost and Uncertain About Future Career Paths**

* **Chain of Thought:**
    * "Okay, I need to break this down logically. What are my skills and interests? What kind of work would allow me to use them?"
    * "What are the different career paths available? What are the pros and cons of each? I need to gather information and research thoroughly."
    * "Is there a way to combine my passions with something practical? Can I create a career that allows me to learn and grow?"
    * "I need to find a path that aligns with my values and allows me to make a meaningful contribution to the world."
    * "It's okay to feel uncertain. The important thing is to keep exploring and seeking new information."

**4. Event:  Experiencing a Personal Failure**

* **Chain of Thought:**
    * "This is a setback, but it's not the end of the world. I need to analyze what went wrong and learn from this experience."
    * "What were the contributing factors to this failure? Was it a lack of preparation, a misunderstanding, or a flaw in my approach?"
    * "How can I adjust my strategy or approach in the future to avoid making the same mistake?"
    * "Failures are opportunities for growth. They force me to re-evaluate my methods and strengthen my understanding."
    * "It's important to remember that failure is a part of the learning process. It's how I learn and improve."

Here's a breakdown of how an INTP high school student might approach "亲情-问题解决" (family-related problem solving) scenarios, along with potential events:

{

"domain": "Family Dynamics",

"events": [

{

"event": "A sibling is struggling academically and needs help but resists your advice.",

"chain of thought": "1. Analyze the situation: What's the root of the problem? Is it lack of understanding, poor study habits, or external pressures? 2. Consider their learning style and personality: How can I tailor my approach to be most effective? 3. Explore potential solutions: Are there specific study strategies or resources that might help? 4. Frame it logically:  Emphasize the practical benefits of improvement rather than focusing on emotional consequences. 5. Respect their autonomy: Acknowledge their resistance and avoid forcing solutions. Suggest solutions, but allow them to choose their own path. 6. Offer support and resources: Provide a safe space for them to discuss their struggles,  help them find relevant study materials, or offer to study together. 7. Focus on understanding: Try to understand their perspective and any underlying issues that might be contributing to their struggles. 8. Observe and adapt: Be patient and flexible, adjusting your approach as needed."

"event": "Parents are having a disagreement and it's impacting the family atmosphere.",

"chain of thought": "1. Observe and analyze: Identify the core issue behind the disagreement. What are the underlying needs and values at play? 2. Seek to understand their perspectives: Why do they disagree? What are their motivations? 3.  Apply logic and reason: Is there a compromise or solution that addresses both parties' needs? 4. Consider long-term consequences: How will this disagreement impact the family dynamics in the long run? 5. De-escalate the situation:  If possible, encourage a calm and rational discussion. 6.  Offer a neutral perspective:  Share your observations and try to bridge the gap between their perspectives. 7. Respect their autonomy: Avoid taking sides or dictating solutions. 8. Prioritize family harmony: Focus on finding a resolution that minimizes conflict and promotes a peaceful family environment."

{

"event": "A family member is facing a difficult personal decision and seeks your advice.",

"chain of thought": "1. Listen actively:  Pay close attention to their concerns and feelings. Ask clarifying questions to fully understand the situation. 2. Analyze the problem:  Identify the key factors influencing the decision. What are the potential consequences of each option? 3. Apply logical reasoning:  Weigh the pros and cons of each choice. Consider the potential impact on their well-being and future. 4. Offer insights and perspectives:  Share your observations and insights, but avoid imposing your own opinions. 5. Empower them:  Ultimately, it's their decision. Encourage them to follow their heart and make the choice that feels right for them. 6.  Offer support:  Let them know you're there for them, regardless of their decision. 7.  Respect their privacy:  Avoid sharing their personal information with others without their consent. 8. Focus on understanding:  Try to see the situation from their point of view, even if you don't agree with their decision."

{

"event": "A family member is experiencing a personal crisis (e.g., mental health struggles, job loss, relationship problems).",

"chain of thought": "1.  Offer practical support:  Provide tangible assistance, such as helping with errands, childcare, or financial support. 2.  Emphasize emotional understanding:  Acknowledge their struggles and validate their feelings. 3.  Seek to understand their perspective:  Ask them about their experiences and challenges. 4.  Connect them with resources:  If appropriate, help them find professional support or community resources. 5.  Maintain boundaries:  While offering support, recognize your limitations.  It's okay to set boundaries to protect your own well-being. 6.  Be patient and understanding:  Recognize that healing takes time. Be patient with them and avoid judgment. 7.  Prioritize their needs:  Focus on their well-being and  offer support in a way that respects their autonomy and preferences."

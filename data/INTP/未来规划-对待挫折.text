Here's a breakdown of how an INTP American high school student might approach the theme of "未来规划-对待挫折" (future planning and dealing with setbacks) in different real-life scenarios:

```json
{
  "domain": "Future Planning & Dealing with Setbacks",
  "events": [
    {
      "event": "Choosing a college major",
      "chain of thought": "1. Analyze personal interests and strengths. 2. Research different fields and their potential career paths. 3. Evaluate the practicality and long-term viability of each option. 4. Consider the intellectual challenges and opportunities offered by each major. 5. Research universities and programs that align with my chosen field. 6. Evaluate the pros and cons of each program based on factors like faculty, research opportunities, and curriculum. 7. Consider potential setbacks like changing interests, job market fluctuations, and financial constraints. 8. Develop contingency plans or backup options in case my initial choice doesn't work out. 9. Ultimately, I want to choose a major that aligns with my intellectual curiosity and provides a path towards a fulfilling career." 
    },
    {
      "event": "Failing a test or receiving a low grade",
      "chain of thought": "1. Analyze where I went wrong. 2. Identify areas where my understanding is lacking. 3. Re-evaluate my study methods and strategies. 4. Consider alternative learning approaches that might be more effective. 5. Look for patterns or underlying causes for the failure (e.g., lack of time management, poor study environment). 6. Seek feedback from teachers or mentors on how to improve. 7. Develop a plan to address the weaknesses and improve my performance in the future. 8. Remind myself that setbacks are opportunities for growth and learning."
    },
    {
      "event": "Being rejected from a dream internship or college",
      "chain of thought": "1. Analyze the reasons for rejection. 2. Examine my application and identify potential areas for improvement. 3. Reassess my goals and consider alternative paths or opportunities. 4. Seek feedback from mentors or career advisors on how to improve my chances of success in the future. 5. Reflect on my strengths and weaknesses. 6. Develop a plan to address the identified weaknesses and become a more competitive applicant. 7. Remember that rejection is a part of the process and does not define my potential." 
    },
    {
      "event": "Experiencing a social setback or misunderstanding",
      "chain of thought": "1. Analyze the situation objectively, considering different perspectives. 2. Identify the root cause of the misunderstanding. 3. Evaluate my own communication style and potential areas for improvement. 4. Consider how my introverted nature might contribute to social challenges. 5. Seek to understand the emotional impact of my actions on others. 6. Develop strategies for clearer and more effective communication. 7. Remind myself that social interactions are a learning process and that mistakes are inevitable. 8. Focus on building genuine connections with people who share my interests and values."

Here's a breakdown of how an INTP American high school student might approach "未来规划-应对挫折" (future planning and coping with setbacks) scenarios:

Domain:  Future Planning & Coping with Setbacks

Events & Chain of Thought:

1. Event:  Choosing a College Major

 Chain of Thought:
     Analyze Interests: "What subjects truly fascinate me? What do I enjoy learning about, even if it's not directly related to a career?"
     Research Career Paths: "What are the potential careers associated with each major? What are the job market trends for these fields? What are the long-term earning potential and job security?"
     Consider Practicality: "Is this major practical for my financial situation and future goals? Will it allow me to live a life that aligns with my values?"
     Assess Personal Strengths and Weaknesses: "What are my natural abilities and talents? Where do I need to improve or develop skills? Does this major align with my strengths and allow me to leverage them?"
     Explore Alternative Paths: "Are there other majors that might be a better fit for me? Could I pursue a double major or minor to broaden my options? Could I combine my interests in a unique way?"
     Seek Mentorship: "Would it be helpful to talk to a professional in the field or someone who has chosen a similar path?"
     Consider Flexibility: "How adaptable is this field?  Are there opportunities for growth and change over time? Will I be able to transition into other roles if needed?"

2. Event:  Dealing with a Disappointing Test Score

 Chain of Thought:
     Analyze the Situation: "Where did I go wrong? What specific concepts or areas did I struggle with? Did I make any strategic errors in preparation?"
     Examine Study Habits: "Were my study methods effective? Could I have organized my time and resources more efficiently?"
     Identify Potential Solutions: "Do I need to spend more time on certain subjects? Should I try different study strategies? Would seeking help from a tutor or teacher be beneficial?"
     Avoid Emotional Overreaction: "While disappointing, this is just one test. It doesn't define my intelligence or future success. It's an opportunity to learn and improve."
     Focus on the Process: "Instead of dwelling on the result, I need to focus on the process of learning and understanding. I can learn from my mistakes and become stronger."
     Seek Feedback: "What advice can my teacher or peers offer to help me improve? Can they suggest any resources or learning strategies?"

3. Event:  Failing to Make the School's Soccer Team

 Chain of Thought:
     Analyze Performance: "Was I truly not good enough? Did I make any mistakes during tryouts? Was the competition just too strong?"
     Assess Goals: "Was making the team truly important to me? Was it just a way to fit in? Did I have other interests I could pursue instead?"
     Explore Alternatives: "Are there other ways I can participate in sports or physical activity? Could I join a club team or find another way to channel my athletic energy?"
     Consider Other Priorities: "Are there other academic or extracurricular activities that align more with my values and interests?  Could I devote my time and energy to those instead?"
     Seek Growth: "What lessons can I learn from this experience? Can I use this as motivation to improve my skills? Can I leverage this experience to build resilience and perseverance?"

4. Event:  Dealing with Peer Pressure to Conform

 Chain of Thought:
     Define Personal Values: "What truly matters to me? What are my core beliefs and principles? What do I stand for?"
     Analyze the Situation: "Why is this peer pressure occurring? What are they trying to achieve? Is it truly important to them or just a fleeting fad?"
     Consider Consequences: "What are the potential consequences of conforming? Would I be sacrificing my authenticity? Would it harm my relationships or my own sense of self-worth?"
     Communicate Assertively: "Can I find a way to express my values and boundaries in a respectful and assertive way? Can I find common ground with those who are pressuring me?"
     Seek Support: "Can I rely on friends or family members who share my values or who can understand my perspective?"
     Stay True to Myself: "It's more important to be true to myself than to fit in with everyone else. My values and individuality are what make me unique."

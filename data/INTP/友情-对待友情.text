Respect boundaries: While I want to be supportive, I'll also be mindful of my friend's need for space and privacy. 5. Focus on understanding their perspective:  I'll try to see things from their point of view, even if I don't fully agree with their emotions or choices. 6. Remain patient: I'll understand that emotional processing takes time and may not be linear.  7. Offer consistent support: I'll be a reliable presence in their life, even when things get tough."

Build connections with individuals: If I find someone with shared interests or perspectives, I might seek to cultivate a deeper connection."
